# Hello there, I'm Kaue! 👋  

I’m a passionate **Front-End Engineer** based in **Toronto, Canada** 🍁 and I bring over a decade of experience developing user-focused digital solutions, from marketing and corporate websites to large-scale applications and e-commerce platforms. 

For the past few years I've been focusing on the **JavaScript ecosystem, working with TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, modern UI frameworks** and **custom design systems**, but I’m always eager to explore new technologies.

➡️ You can find more about me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kauecorrea/), [Kaue.ca](https://www.kaue.ca) or check my [CodePen](https://codepen.io/KaueCode).
